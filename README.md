## 🛡️ Environment Variables (Firebase Config)

Store your Firebase keys securely using environment variables.

### `.env` (should NOT be committed)

```env
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_project.firebaseapp.com
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_project.appspot.com
VITE_FIREBASE_MSG_SENDER_ID=your_sender_id
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
````

These are accessed in your Firebase config like this:

```js
const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: import.meta.env.VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY,
  ...
};
```
